# Citi Bike Sharing Analysis 

## Overview of the Statistical Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to help create a business proposal for a bike-sharing company that would be based prospecitvely in Des Moines, Iowa. In order to convince a potential Angel investor to provide seed funding for the business, a statistical analysis was performed using public data from another bike-sharing company, Citi Bike. The data available is sourced from metrics within New York City, as Citi Bike is a privately-owned public bike sharing system that only operates within NYC buroughs. Information spanning from user demographics to trip duration to help answer potential questions if we were to open a bike-sharing business in Des Moines. Tableau Public, a data visualization software, is used as the primary tool to our business proposal.
