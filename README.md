# Citi Bike Sharing Analysis 

## Overview of the Statistical Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to help create a business proposal for a bike-sharing company that would prospectively be based in Des Moines, Iowa. In order to convince a potential Angel investor to provide seed funding for the business, a statistical analysis was performed using public data from another bike-sharing company, Citi Bike. The data available is sourced from metrics within New York City, as Citi Bike is a privately-owned public bike sharing system that only operates within NYC buroughs. Information spanning from user demographics to trip duration was used to help answer any potential questions from investors if we were to open a bike-sharing business in Des Moines. Tableau Public, a data visualization software, is used as the primary tool for our business proposal.

## Summary

Several generalizations can be drawn from the statistical analyses from the Citi Bike NYC data that can be applied to prospective business in Des Moines, Iowa. The most transcations for a bike-sharing business would occur towards the latter half of the weekend, especially weekends. We draw this from "User Trips by Gender by Weekday" graph and we can also presume that bike-sharing users are more likely to use the service on the weekends when they have more leisurely time. All genders used bike-sharing services equally in terms of duration, however there was still more double the amount of bike-sharing users that were male, than those who identified as female. Thus, to make the bike-sharing service more marketable to female users in Des Moines, we must understand their needs and expectations. Some options to consider are safety and safety, as well as accessibility. In NYC, we see 4 times as many subscribers as customers, a successful figure. A subscription incentive can be applied to Des Moines if the frequency of rides is high enough for users to find it more economical to subscribe.
