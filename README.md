# Citi Bike Sharing Analysis 

## Overview of the Statistical Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to help create a business proposal for a bike-sharing company that would prospectively be based in Des Moines, Iowa. In order to convince a potential Angel investor to provide seed funding for the business, a statistical analysis was performed using public data from another bike-sharing company, Citi Bike. The data available is sourced from metrics within New York City, as Citi Bike is a privately-owned public bike sharing system that only operates within NYC buroughs. Information spanning from user demographics to trip duration was used to help answer any potential questions from investors if we were to open a bike-sharing business in Des Moines. Tableau Public, a data visualization software, is used as the primary tool for our business proposal.

## Summary


Additional visualizations were created from statistical analyses on gender and age to help consolidate an understanding of the bike-sharing market for investors. The gender breakdown for customers vs subscribers was analyzed. From the image below, we can conclude that there are 1.62 male customers for Citi-Bike for every 1 female customer. As for subscribers, there are 2.75 males to every 1 female. It is important to further delve into the reason why there is a lower share of female bike-sharing subscribers and it can be better marketed to them in Des Moines, Iowa to ensure business success.

The highest concentration of Citi-Bike users were born in 1969, and the second highest concentration of users were born 1989. The pie chart below depicts the year in which users were born, the number of users that make up that portion, and the color of that group depicts their concentration. The darker the blue is in the chart, the more users make up a portion of Citi-Bike users. The trend shows that the least likely group of people to use Citi-Bike are naturally senior citizens, and those born after 2000.

Several generalizations can be drawn from the statistical analyses from the Citi Bike NYC data that can be applied to prospective business in Des Moines, Iowa. The most transcations for a bike-sharing business would occur towards the latter half of the weekend, especially weekends. We draw this from "User Trips by Gender by Weekday" graph and we can also presume that bike-sharing users are more likely to use the service on the weekends when they have more leisurely time. All genders used bike-sharing services equally in terms of duration, however there was still more double the amount of bike-sharing users that were male, than those who identified as female. Thus, to make the bike-sharing service more marketable to female users in Des Moines, we must understand their needs and expectations. Some options to consider are safety and safety, as well as accessibility. In NYC, we see 4 times as many subscribers as customers, a successful figure. A subscription incentive can be applied to Des Moines if the frequency of rides is high enough for users to find it more economical to subscribe.
